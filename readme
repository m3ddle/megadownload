Megadownload
=============

This is a simple script which will allow you to automatically download in succsession, one or more links to files stored on mega.co.nz.

The script scans your clipboard for mega.co urls and downloads them one by one using megatools 'megadl' command.

Getting Started
=============
Megatools is required to carry out the downloads.
More information and source code for Megatools is available at their website below.
Many distros have megatools available for convenient download and setup through their package manager.

To download files simply copy some links and run the bash script. If installed properly 
this should be as simple as:

	$ megadownload

The downloads will begin immediately. Megatools will track their progress in the terminal.

To specify a directory different than the one you are in for your downloads give the new directory as an argument. Example:

	$ megadownload ~/Downloads

Will download to ~/Downloads

Installation
=============

Run the convenient installation script.

You may have to give execution permission to the files 'megadownload' or 'megadownloader.py'.

You may also have to give execution permission to the installation script.

This is easily accomplished with the following shell command:
	
	$ chmod +x <filename>

If your distro uses sudo:

	$ sudo chmod +x <filename>

Miscellaneous
=============

The idea for this came from the windows program megadownloader.

Ideas for the future include:
	Windows support. 
	Support for adding links from a file.
	A gui.

Changelog
============
Added arguments to specify a different download directory.
